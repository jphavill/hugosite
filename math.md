# Computing Math in Python

A core part of any programming language is it's ability to compute mathematical problems, from processing data sets to calculating what pixels to display on a screen. Just as in traditional mathematics, these problems can be broken down and expressed as samller operations. These include simple operations, such as addition and multiplication, and a few of the more exotic functions like sin and cosine.

## Basic arithmatic operations
1. addition `1 + 2`
2. subtraction `2 - 1`
3. mulitplication `2 * 3`
4. divison `4 / 2`

In python these evalutate to their answers in place. For example, assigning a variable to the value `3 * 2` would give it the value of 6.

```python
myNumber = 3 * 2

print(myNumber)

OUTPUT: 6
```
