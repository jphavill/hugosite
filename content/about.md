# Why This Blog Exists  

While I'm coding, I'm almost always listening to music. When I come to a point where I need more information, and inevitably turn to Google, I hate having to pause the music to watch an entire video tutorial. I would much rather skim through an article, find the exact piece I need, and never have to break my flow. 

This blog is my own attempt at filling that niche. Each article is designed with sub headers that allow it to be easily navigated at a glance, and filled with enough code examples that it should act as a stand-alone guide to a topic, no accompanying video required.

## Who I Am

I am a second year computer science student at Dalhousie University. As I work through my degree, the plan is to fill up this blog as a way to reinforce what I learn, and hopefully create a useful resource for others along the way.
