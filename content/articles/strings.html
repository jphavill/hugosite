<h2></h2>
<p>A string is a data type that stores a series (or "string") of characters. These characters could make up a word, a sentence, or even entire paragraphs. </p><hr>

<h2>The How</h2>
<p>A string is denoted by surrounding characters in either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code> quotes.</p><div class="code">
<div><code>myString = <span class='string'>"This is a string denoted with double quotes"</span>
myOtherString = 'This is also a string<span class='keyword'>,</span> instead denoted with single quotes'</code>
</div></div>
<p>The variable name can then be used in place of the string.</p><div class="code">
<div><code>myString = <span class='string'>"This is a string denoted with double quotes"</span>
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(myString)
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: This is a string denoted with double quotes
</code>
</div>
<h3>Indexes</h3><p>Individual characters of a string can also be accessed using the position, or index, of the character in the string.</p><div class="code">
<div><code>myString = <span class='string'>"ABCD<span class='number'>123</span>!"</span>
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(myString[<span class='number'>2</span>])
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: C
</code>
</div>
<p>You may have noticed that even though index 2 was used, the third character was printed. This is because strings are indexed starting at 0. Here are some more examples.</p><div class="code">
<div><code>myString = <span class='string'>"ABCD<span class='number'>123</span>!"</span>
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(myString[<span class='number'>0</span>])
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(myString[<span class='number'>1</span>])
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: A
	B
</code>
</div>
<h3>Slices</h3><p>Sections of a string can also be accessed. This is done using a format called slicing. The start and end index of the section you want to "slice" out of the string is seperated by a colon and placed in sqaure brackets after the string or variable.</p><p>hugo </p><hr>
