<p>A core part of any programming language is it's ability to compute mathematical problems, from processing data sets to calculating what pixels to display on a screen. Just as in traditional mathematics, these problems can be broken down and expressed as samller operations. These include simple operations, such as addition and multiplication, and a few of the more exotic functions like sin and cosine. </p><hr>

<h2>Basic arithmatic operations</h2>
<p>1. addition <code><span class='number'>1</span> <span class='symbol'>+</span> <span class='number'>2</span></code></p><p>2. subtraction <code><span class='number'>2</span> <span class='symbol'>-</span> <span class='number'>1</span></code></p><p>3. mulitplication <code><span class='number'>2</span> <span class='symbol'>*</span> <span class='number'>3</span></code></p><p>4. divison <code><span class='number'>4</span> <span class='symbol'>/</span> <span class='number'>2</span></code></p><p>In python these evalutate to their answers in place. For example, assigning a variable to the value <code><span class='number'>3</span> <span class='symbol'>*</span> <span class='number'>2</span></code> would give it the value of 6.</p><div class="code">
<div><code>myNumber = <span class='number'>3</span> <span class='symbol'>*</span> <span class='number'>2</span>

<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(myNumber)
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: 6
</code>
