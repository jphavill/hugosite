<h2></h2>
<p>The easiest way for a program to display output to the user is to print out text to the screen. The print function accomplished this by printing whatever is passed to it to the console.</p></section>
<section>
<h2>The How</h2>
<p>A print function is called just like any other function, with the name of the function followed by opening and closing parenthesis <code><span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>()</code>. To pass an argument to the function, it is simply placed within the parenthesis.</p><div class="code">
<div><code><span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(<span class='string'>"Hello World"</span>)
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: Hello World
</code>
</div>
<p>This passed argument can be of almost any type, and can be stored in a variable. Multiple arguments can even be passed into one print function.</p><div class="code">
<div><code><span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(<span class='number'>7</span><span class='keyword'>,</span> <span class='string'>"a"</span>)
var = [<span class='string'>"entry <span class='keyword'>in</span> a <span class='nativeFunc'>list</span>"</span><span class='keyword'>,</span> <span class='string'>"entry two"</span>]
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(var)
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: 7, a
OUTPUT: ["entry in a list", "entry two"]
</code>
</div>
<p>If no argument is passed, the print function will default to creating a newline. This means that it moves the output to the next line.</p><div class="code">
<div><code><span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(<span class='string'>"part one"</span>)
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>()
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(<span class='string'>"part two"</span>)
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: part one
OUTPUT:
OUTPUT: part two
</code>
</div>
</section>

<h2>Communication and Debugging</h2>
<p>Displaying output to the screen is useful for two main reasons, firstly as the simplest way for a program to communicate with a user, and secondly as a method of debugging errors.</p><p>An example of using the print statement to communicate with the user</p><div class="code">
<div><code>x = <span class='number'>5</span>
y = <span class='number'>4</span>
answer = x <span class='symbol'>+</span> y
<span class='nativeFunc'>print</span>(‘The answer is’<span class='keyword'>,</span> answer)
</code>
</div></div>
<div class="output">
<code>OUTPUT: The answer is 9
</code>
</div>
<p>Creating a graphical user interface, or gui, is not needed for many applications, and would grow a relatively small project in to a much larger one if it was included. For this reason command line based applications are not only accepted, but encouraged unless a gui is truly needed. </p></section>
