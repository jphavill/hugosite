# Sorting Arrays Using Bubblesort

Bubble sort is an algorithm used to sort an array of items in ascending or descending order. These items could be anything from numbers, to strings, to other objects such as lists as long as the way to compare between the items is defined.

## The How

Bubble sort works by comparing each item to its neighbour, and swapping them if they are out of order. The algorithm continues looping through the array being sorted until a pass is made where no swaps are made. As no swaps were made, there were no items out of order and therefore the list is sorted.
