# Strings

A string is a data type that stores a series (or "string") of characters. These characters could make up a word, a sentence, or even entire paragraphs.

## The How

A string is denoted by surrounding characters in either single `'` or double `"` quotes.

```py
myString = "This is a string denoted with double quotes"
myOtherString = 'This is also a string, instead denoted with single quotes'
```
The variable name can then be used in place of the string.

```py
myString = "This is a string denoted with double quotes"
print(myString)

OUTPUT: This is a string denoted with double quotes
```

### Indexes

Individual characters of a string can also be accessed using the position, or index, of the character in the string.

```py
myString = "ABCD123!"
print(myString[2])

OUTPUT: C
```
You may have noticed that even though index 2 was used, the third character was printed. This is because strings are indexed starting at 0. Here are some more examples.

```py
myString = "ABCD123!"
print(myString[0])
print(myString[1])

OUTPUT: A
B
```

### Slices

Sections of a string can also be accessed. This is done using a format called slicing. The start and end index of the section you want to "slice" out of the string is seperated by a colon and placed in sqaure brackets after the string or variable.
