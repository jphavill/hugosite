        <h2 id="why-this-blog-exists">Why This Blog Exists</h2>
<p>While I&rsquo;m coding, I&rsquo;m almost always listening to music. When I come to a point where I need more information, and inevitably turn to Google, I hate having to pause the music to watch an entire video tutorial. I would much rather skim through an article, find the exact piece I need, and never have to break my flow.</p>
<p>This blog is my own attempt at filling that niche. Each article is designed with sub headers that allow it to be easily navigated at a glance, and filled with enough code examples that it should act as a stand-alone guide to a topic, no accompanying video required.</p>
<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h2>
<p>I am a second year computer science student at Dalhousie University. As I work through my degree, the plan is to fill up this blog as a way to reinforce what I learn, and hopefully create a useful resource for others along the way.</p>
