# Managing Projects with Version Control

Version control serves three main purposes:

1. It allows the same code to be worked on by two or more people simultaneously
2. It allows separate areas of code to be developed independently 
3. It allows changes between versions to be compared, especially useful in determining when and where a bug was introduced
